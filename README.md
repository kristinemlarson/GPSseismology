# GPSseismology

I believe these are the Denali GPS seismology results as published 
in [BSSA](https://www.kristinelarson.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/bilich_bssa.pdf)

We converted the results into SAC and attempted to archive these 
files at IRIS. We belatedly discovered that 
IRIS had improperly an instrument response to our records, 
thus contaminating them.

There is an ascii dump as well as the original SAC files.  

Questions regarding the analysis should be sent to Andria Bilich at NOAA.

Best regards,
